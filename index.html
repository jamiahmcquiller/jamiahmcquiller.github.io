								<h2>Welcome to My Portfolio<br /> </h2>
								<!-- eget augue amet aliquet nisl cep donec</h2> -->
								<p>As an IT Co-op at Nexteer Automotive, I assist my supervisor in various administrative tasks, build and troubleshoot computers, and provide technical support to our business customers. I use my skills in Google Kubernetes Engine, Virtual Machines, and Cloud Development to deploy applications, monitor operations, and manage enterprise solutions. I also participate in on-the-job learning opportunities and build personal networks within the IT department.
									<br />
									I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity, with a minor in Computer Science, at the University of Michigan-Flint. I have completed coursework in Python, Java, Windows, Linux, and Information Technology, and I have earned multiple certifications, such as the International Cyber Threat Task Force, Learn Python 3 by Making a Game, and Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program. I am passionate about using computational methods to solve problems related to cardiovascular diseases, and I work as an undergraduate research assistant in a lab that focuses on this area. My goal is to apply my knowledge and experience in Cybersecurity, Computer Science, and Cloud Infrastructure to help organizations protect their data and systems from cyber threats.</p>

								<h2>Assessing Affect and Engagement in Human Robot Teaming<br /> </h2>
								<!-- sed ullamcorper</h2> -->
								<p>I provided valuable assistance to Associate Professor of Computer Science Mark Allison in his significant role within a large NSF-funded research project focused on teamwork and robotics. Collaborating closely with Professor Allison, I actively contributed to the analysis of cutting-edge software designed to discern human emotions using an impressive array of state-of-the-art data collection tools. These tools encompassed the Emotiv EEG headset, the Facial Action Coding System, the Brain-Computer Interface, and OpenFace. My role involved a comprehensive investigation into how these advanced data collection tools could enable robots to adapt to the ever-changing emotional and stress-related fluctuations in human behavior. Specifically, I employed OpenFace's affect recognition software to identify the six fundamental emotions (anger, sadness, surprise, fear, disgust, and happiness). While these emotions generally manifest themselves in facial muscles in a fairly consistent manner, it's important to note that certain factors like deception, individual emotional baselines, or cultural distinctions could introduce variations. To address this, Professor Allison and I complemented our facial analysis with EEG readings obtained from an Emotiv Insight headset. Upon concluding our analysis, we made a significant discovery: the combined use of the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) could effectively capture and reflect emotional states. This breakthrough represents a crucial advancement in our ongoing efforts to enhance the collaboration and performance of teams composed of both robots and humans.</p>

								<h2>REVOLUTIONIZING CARDIAC HEALTHCARE WITH VR VISUALIZATION <br /> </h2>
								 <!-- elementum magna</h2> -->
								<p>As a research assistant in UM-Flint’s Computational Medicine and Biomechanics Lab, under the guidance of Yasser Aboelkassem, assistant professor of digital manufacturing technology, I’ve played a crucial role in developing a ‘Patient-Specific VR’ software. This innovative technology is focused on 4D Flow Cardiac MRI Data Visualization through VR technology, holds immense potential to reshape cardiac healthcare. By merging real-time 4D data manipulation with immersive VR, we aim to address the growing demand for advanced medical visualization tools. Our unique selling points include improved spatial understanding, enhanced communication, and a transformative impact on cardiac diagnostics and treatment planning. With a seasoned team combining expertise in cardiac imaging, VR technology, and software development, we are poised to lead in this space. Seeking investment to fuel development, we project significant growth through licensing, partnerships, and subscription models. This venture not only offers a breakthrough solution but also holds the promise of revolutionizing how cardiac health is visualized, understood, and treated.</p>

							<h2>4D Flow Cardiac MRI Data Visualization using Virtual Reality (VR) Technology<br /> </h2>
							<!-- sed condimentum</h2> -->
							<p>Zillion Solutions is an esteemed campus-wide competition that beckons graduate, undergraduate students from all disciplines, including undecided scholars, dual enrolled individuals, and even Genesee County high school students, to unleash their creativity by crafting either a concise video or a compelling slide deck outlining their groundbreaking concepts for novel products or services aimed at solving real-world problems. In this dynamic arena of innovation, I proudly showcased my visionary project centered around harnessing the power of Virtual Reality (VR) technology to revolutionize the visualization of 4D Flow Cardiac MRI Data. The realm of 4D flow cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) stands as a pinnacle in modern imaging techniques, furnishing unparalleled insights into the intricate workings of heart chambers and arterial networks with unprecedented detail. With each advancement in 4D flow MRI, the horizon of cardiovascular disease evaluation broadens, offering clinicians an unmatched arsenal for conducting comprehensive quantitative assessments of blood flows within the cardiovascular system. Yet, in the quest for excellence, I recognized a potential avenue for further enhancement. The effectiveness of 4D flow MRI, while formidable on its own, could soar to unprecedented heights through integration with real-time immersive visualization technologies, particularly Virtual Reality (VR) systems. Through diligent research and innovation, I embarked on the journey of creating a bespoke VR environment meticulously tailored to seamlessly integrate 4D flow MRI scans with cutting-edge wireless VR systems. This innovative synergy not only empowers medical professionals to interact with the scanned data in real-time but also facilitates the extraction of quantitative features, thereby amplifying the precision of cardiovascular diagnostics to unprecedented levels. This project propelled me from the ranks of semi-finalists to the coveted position of a finalist, eventually clinching the prestigious title of 1st Runner-up amidst fierce competition, with a staggering 863 submissions vying for recognition. It stands as a testament to the transformative potential of merging technology with healthcare, underscoring the profound impact that innovation can wield in reshaping the landscape of medical diagnostics and treatment.</p>
